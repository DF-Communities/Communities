    <subject>Some useful information to help you make Dementia Friends in your organisation</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{contact_name}},

Thank you for registering a Dementia Friends account for {{partner_name}}. You will be pleased to know that you are moments away from being able to watch and share our online videos for organisations.

Please take a moment to read the below information as it may help answer any queries.

Important information: 

- You will be the main point of contact for {{partner_name}} - If you want to add someone else as an admin for your organisation you can do so easily via your organisation dashboard

- On your Dementia Friends Organisation Dashboard, you can track the amount of people in {{partner_name}} who have become Dementia Friends.

Log in details:

- To log into your account, please click here (https://www.dementiafriends.org.uk/WEBLogin) and enter the email address and password you set up on registering.

- Your organisation code is {{partner_code}}. This is a unique code that can be distributed to your colleagues to enable them to access the Dementia Friends videos. They do not need your log in details.

Communicating to colleagues

- Tell colleagues to click here (https://www.dementiafriends.org.uk/DF_WEBC_PartnerVideos?page=videos-for-organisations) and when prompted enter your code, the number of new people watching at that time, and the postcode from where they are watching.

- To become a Dementia Friend, colleagues have to watch ‘Understanding Dementia’ and at least one other video

- Please note we do not record names, just numbers and postcodes, so you will need to find a way to know who has watched the videos so you can send out a badge and actioncard to them. We recommend the viewer sending a screenshot from the final frame of the second video, by email, to someone internally. 

Badges and action cards:

- As the Organisation Administrator, you can request badges and action cards for your staff by emailing us with the following information: 1: Name of organisation, 2: Address to send badges to 3: Number of Dementia Friends created/target number of Friends 4: Number of required badges and action cards needed.

Did you know:

- If you have staff who are Dementia Friends Champions, they can be linked to your account. If you wish to do so, please email us your unique code and the Champion&apos;s email address(es)
- If you are a larger organisation, there are other routes available to create Dementia Friends too – get in touch with us if you would like more information

Any queries: 

- Email programmepartnerships@alzheimers.org.uk

Good luck with your rollout of Dementia Friends,

The Programme Partnerships Team</textOnly>
