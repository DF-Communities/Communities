    <subject>Dementia-Friendly Communities Annual Assessment Reminder â€“ {{xM_reminder}} !</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{contact_name}},

This is a reminder that the annual self-assessment report for {{community_name}} will be  {{xM_reminder}}.

As part of the Dementia-Friendly Communities recognition process you are required to complete an online self-assessment questionnaire to provide an update on the progress your community has made so far towards becoming dementia-friendly.

You will be notified again on {{assessment_due_date}} with a link to the questionnaire for you to complete

We look forward to hearing from you and do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any further questions.

Best wishes
